# Passage
> If Henry had been there he could have told me what to do. His great voice, tuned and broken at the capstan bar, would have breezily put me right. Tears came to my eyes. I was, I supposed, an emotional old fool. So I came back and waited in Orchard, it ran through my head, where he cast up blinded that night, which were my true friend Ravager, which were always good to me since we was almost pups, and never minded of my short legs. Very emotional. But there was no need for me to weep just at the end of the second dog, nor would I. Henry had taught me a little of his trade, and this, curiously enough, was what had struck. After all the Grundy Sapphic of yesterday had described a more universal taking off in Ireland. I did not quite agree with Thomas de Quincey that murders in Ireland did not count. But perhaps it was an optimistic memory which told me that such things used not to happen when the queer old Dean was alive.

After [[Death of Henry]]
If the Spoonerism is correct, then this happens on Monday
Multiple [[Spoonerism]]s since there is also [[queer old Dean]] (dear old queen) - [[Queen Victoria]] or the same queen as in [[04 - A little boy tumbles into the sea]]?

[[On Murder Considered One of the Fine Arts]] by [[Thomas de Quincey]]
[[Treasure Island]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].

So does this mean that [[Henry]] is [[the old sea dog]]?

##### Puzzles:
"grundy sapphic" could be the "sunday graphic" -- [[Spoonerism]]

###### Unsure:

### Notes:
Is Henry a sailor? then his trade would be sailing

turns out the murders in Ireland are in fact actual murders in ireland:
>Tithes, politics, or something wrong in principle, vitiate every Irish murder. Gentlemen, this must be reformed, or Ireland will not be a land to live in; at least, if we do live there, we must import all our murders, that's clear."
