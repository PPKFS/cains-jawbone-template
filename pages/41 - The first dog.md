# Passage
> And then with horrid clearness I had seen a woman---not actually, if I could trust myself, there ; but aiming, directing, inspiring : slim, tawny, petulant, self-willed : wanton, but too calculated to be more than mistress of herself ; [the kind that had made England terribly at sea](app://obsidian.md/Treasure%20Island). I looked back on my own youth ; I had been about a bit, as they say ; sometimes, to catch a whale, I had cast a sprat over the windmill. But it was not till my marriage with Henry that old [Charles Goodfellow](app://obsidian.md/Charles%20Goodfellow) dared to hint that I was going gay. Poor lonely little Bat. But it was still [the first dog](app://obsidian.md/the%20first%20dog), I couldn’t help realising that, after my husband’s training. Just as I could not help realising that, had I a mind to go there, I could now get moled and isled on the [Selfridge](app://obsidian.md/Selfridge) side, though by no means in [Bond Street](app://obsidian.md/Bond%20Street). When I said means, I meant of course lawful ones. Then I remembered [Henry](app://obsidian.md/Henry)’s favourite quotation :

> *But M’Cullough ‘e wanted cabins with marble  
and maple and all  
And Brussels an’ Utrecht velvet, and bath and a  
Social Hall
