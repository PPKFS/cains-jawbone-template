# Passage
> Then came Hyacinth’s day. He laughed when he remembered that, as we were walking round the garden, and said it was too late for Jasmine's day at any rate. I liked to hear him laugh, and thought it was absurd for him to be called after what the man Boots didn’t understand. The latter’s way of expressing himself seemed to me childish ; why should we, of all people, use singular for plural and plural for singular? They went back two days and formulated their bet, till I could have howled. If he got the third point, she’d owe him a box of a hundred Egyptian cigarettes-Gourdoulis, and if she won, he’d give her three pairs of Etam dawn mist, ten inches. They looked so bright about it all. She drooped long seed pearl things right over the soup. Ear-drops, as my mother had called them, I never could abide ; probably because I belonged to the other side of the family. My mistress wore them ; was it for that that I had begun to tire of her already?

Who is the 'she' that places the bet with Hyacinth, I think? Is it Jasmine?  
Many characters here seem to be from [Thy Servant a Dog](app://obsidian.md/Thy%20Servant%20a%20Dog) by [Rudyard Kipling](app://obsidian.md/Rudyard%20Kipling)

The use of "the _man_ Boots" makes me wonder [are all the dogs humans and vice versa](app://obsidian.md/are%20all%20the%20dogs%20humans%20and%20vice%20versa)  
What Boots does not understand in the short story:

-   We go to top of House. There is Adar and kennels-that-shut. She fills with things off Gods' feets and tops and middles.  
    this is listed as [August](app://obsidian.md/August) [1923](app://obsidian.md/1923) so I think it's this paragraph
