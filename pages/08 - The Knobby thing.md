# Passage
> Could I be developing a green-eyed streak? I investigated the body before me with the aid of a powerful glass. At least I always thought of it as powerful, because I could never quite understand how it worked. I knew I ought to have the body as long as possible. At last I was satisfied. I measured the distance carefully with my eye : a good forty inches, I made it. I gathered from his talk that Guido looked his last to-day on the sausage place-furtively I knew how excellent-and that Kilmarnock and Belmerino completely lost their heads. But whether or not this was cause and effect I couldnâ€™t make out. I wished for the hundredth time I had a better brain. Later she was wearing the same bow-I loathed bows myself-and that time he found them and trimmed the left end. Then he turned what he was holding a bit ; so that it pushed its way right through. Then he twiddled the black knobby thing, and Mr. Hall burst in upon us. The knobby thing was black and red.
