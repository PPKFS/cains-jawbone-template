# Passage
> Now, I considered, in my dear Lyons it would be coming of age hours, and I wondered if they would ever do that over here. I fancied what self-consciousness and preciosity there would be, for instance, if the B.B.C. ever took it up. A strange institution ; but the nursed fuse was always interesting. Yes, if sitting at the familiar table with Bart chewing at my moccasins, I could have broadcast it all, I would have left the mighty heart of England to deal with it. On that very day, I recalled, another terrible thing happened. John Hewit and Sarah Drew, just engaged to be married, were working together in a field of barley when they were both struck by lightning. Alexander, the only noteworthy Pope of my native land, was demonstrably affected. And my namesake wrote a letter, in which he said that Sarahâ€™s left eye was injured, and there appeared a black spot on her breast. Her lover was all over black ; but not the least sign of life was found in either.

[[A Tragic Tale of a Lightning Romance of John Hewit and Sarah Drew]] by [[Alexander Pope]]
## Characters:
[[301 Cain's Jawbone/301.01 Characters/Bart]] - a character from [[Thy Servant a Dog]] by [[Rudyard Kipling]]

I suspect that the "mighty heart" is [[Composed Upon Westminster Bridge]] by [[William Wordsworth]], where this refers specifically to the beating nature of [[London]].

## Locations:
Is the "familiar table" also the [[appointed table]]?
More discussion of [[my namesake]] - is this [[Alexander]]? Yes it must be

Is nursed fuse a [[Spoonerism]] of "first news", which ties up to the BBC?

So the narrator is thinking back to [[that very day]] which was [[31st of July]].

is the familiar table [[appointed table]]?
